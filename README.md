Hello, I'm a college student that occasionally programs.

To be perfectly honest, I just like dipping my toes in everything. From machine learning to cryptography, web development to compilers, I consider myself a jack of all trades (but master of none). I've been fortunate enough to have the time to program in a variety of languages, such as Rust, Python, TypeScript, and Go, but languages are easy enough to learn that there's no real merit to listing them all.
